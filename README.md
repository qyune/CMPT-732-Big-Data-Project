# Game Tweets and Sales: Texting Mining Project using Big Data Technologies

## Team members:
Pengyu Wang & Kyoun Huh

## Introduction
This project aims to gain meaningful insights from online discussions about video games. Text mining techniques and NLP algorithms will be applied, which may include but not limited to: sentiment analysis through time and keyword extraction for each game genre. In addition, unstructured text data will be processed and joined with game sales data, which are tabular data in traditional relational formats. Machine learning models will be built to predict first month sales for games, based on the online discussion one month before their launches. The ideal model should be interpretable, which means users could not only see the predicted sales numbers but also obtain explainable feature importance, i.e. which words in discussion may indicate high sales. The results of analysis will be demonstrated by a one-page visualization dashboard and a report.
